	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		This is an app for Hide and Seek players that know, or want to learn, <b
			>how to play the game across a large city area</b
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're inspired by the Jet Lag: The Game show, their games across Switzerland and Japan, and
		their card game presentation in New York City. City-wide Hide and Seek is <b>very fun</b>, but
		too much of organizing the game is up to the players. Here's a utility to write about the
		organization process, in your place!
	</p>
	<p>
		Add rules, set game periods, include challenges, help interested tourists - make the game easier
		for your friends!
